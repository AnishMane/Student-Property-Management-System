## About The Project
### Overview
UniStorage is a comprehensive student property management system developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This project aims to streamline the management, tracking, and allocation of student-owned properties such as mattresses, blankets, buckets, and other essential items within a campus or student housing environment. The system is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and scalable, catering to the needs of both students and administrators.

### Objectives
### 🚀 Efficient Management: 
To provide a centralized platform for managing student properties, reducing the administrative burden on staff.
### 🔍 Transparency: 
To enhance transparency in the allocation and return of items, ensuring that students and staff can easily track the status of each item.
### 🎨 User-Friendly Interface: 
To offer a simple and intuitive interface for both students and administrators, making the process of borrowing and returning items hassle-free.
### ⚖️ Scalability: 
To ensure the system can handle a growing number of users and properties without compromising performance.
